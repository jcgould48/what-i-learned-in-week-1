## **What I Learned In Week 1 at Code Immersives**

**Macbook Setup 2.0**

The week started off slow as a result of having to setup the computers once again.  However this really highlighted some of the things that we've learned as the process went much quicker.


**Bash**

We continue to work on our skills through bash.  One of the exercises really enforced the skills of creating and moving files
    
    At this point I feel very comfortable with the Bash format.


**Git**

I have become far more familiar with Git and creating repositories.  Within this week we have built many repositories. 

Some of the things we focused on

* Further practicing cloning, pushing and updating process

* We talked about the process of forking 

* Through Github we were also able to create a linked story with links and various pathways

I still think there are a few aspects of Git that I don't feel completely confident about.  Some aspects I am still confused on:
1. What is the echo command?
2. What happens if I don't do the steps they mention for a new repository in the right order.  
3. What does git pull do again?

**Visual Studio Code**

We focused a lot of attention on visual studio code.  One of the lessons was better understanding shortcuts for cursor movement and editing text.

#### Cursor Movement

* Command-left arrow - move cursor to beginning of line
* Command-right arrow - move cursor to end of line
* Option-left arrow - move cursor one word to the left
* Option-right arrow - move cursor one word to the right


#### Selection

* Shift + any cursor movement - expand selection by that amount
* Option-click - place a multi-cursor
* Command-D - Additionally select next instance of current selection.
* Command-Shift-L - Select all instances of current selection.

#### Logic Puzzles
As a class we had to solve some logic puzzles.  Some were difficult but they really engaged us to think.  Over all I enjoyed trying to solve them and think in a way that is not common on a day to day basis.

####  HTML

Finally, we spent a lot of time on HTML and how you can add to the customization using the platform.
