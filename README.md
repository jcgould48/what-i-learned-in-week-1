## **What I Learned In Week 1 at Code Immersives**

**Macbook Setup 2.0**

The week started off slow as a result of having to setup the computers once again.  However this really highlighted some of the things that we've learned as the process went much quicker.


**Bash**

We continue to work on our skills through bash 
* How to start it up


* How to navigate directories
    * It is very important to always know where your at and the appropriate path
    * This is typically done through the `cd` command
* How to see the contents of the directory and the actual directory
    * `ls`: Lists the files 
        * `-a`: A flag that also includes hidden files
    * `pwd`: Shows your current working directory

* How to create, remove, move, and copy files and directories
    * `mkdir`: Creates directories
    * `touch`: Creates files
    * `rm`: Removes files or directories
    * `mv`: Moves files or directories to chosen location
    * `cp`: Copies files or directories to chosen location

**Git**

Description:

A system for tracking changes in source code during software development. It is designed for coordinating work among programmers, but it can be used to track changes in any set of files.

Some of the things I learned about Git:

* The importance of Git for coding in teams and tracking changes

* Problems can arise when there are contradictory changes occurring at the same time

* GitHub has become a popular repository for code

* To properly upload a new file to an individual's GitHub repository they must use these commands in Bash
    * `git add [file name or .]`
    * `git commit -m "description of changes"`
    * `git push`
    * `git status`: will tell you the status of the file in this process 

**markdown**

Description:

A lightweight markup language that you can use to add formatting elements to plaintext text documents. 

Some of the things I learned about markdown:

*  It is simple but extremely versatile and can used for a wide variety of end products

*  Language intuitive for text formatting
    * ##: Makes text more prominent like a title
    * Surrounded with **: Makes text **bold**
    * Surround with *: Makes text *italicized*
    * "*": Adds bullet points
